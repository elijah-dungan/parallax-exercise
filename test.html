                        Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
                        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
                        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
                        As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
                        “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
                        Only this and nothing more.”  
                        <br />  
                        <br /> 
                        Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
                        And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
                        Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
                        From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
                        For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
                        Nameless here for evermore.
                        <br />  
                        <br /> 
                        And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
                        Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
                        So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
                        “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—
                        Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—
                        This it is and nothing more.”
